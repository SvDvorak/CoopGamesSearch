<h3>Camp Explorer</h3>
Bandcamp is a great place to find new and fascinating music.

But you probably have an idea of your type of music so actually finding new things matching that taste is a bit tough.

This tool helps you out by letting you search for different tags/genres/locations and finds albums that match all those criterias.

<h3>Usage</h3>
Type in a search criteria and press add. Repeat for all criterias you want to find albums for. Click the x to the right of the added search criteria to remove it.

When you find an interesting album, click on it to jump to its page.

Note that search criterias that have not been cached previously might take a while for the server to cache up.
